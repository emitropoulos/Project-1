NBA Region Analysis:

In this project we dive into what areas NBA players are coming from the years of 1999 to 2020. We begin by looking at players that were born within the US to see if what regions are contributing the most as well as the least amount of players. What we discovered is that the eastern regions have produced more players in recent years than western regions with the. The Mountain West region in particular has been the lowest producer of NBA talent by a wide margin.

Our next steps were to evaluate the International pool of players to see what areas across the world are producing the most NBA players. In our findings, we noticed that European countries, specifically countries in Southern Europe have produced the most International NBA players. Something that came as a surprise, was that Asian countries have produced the least amount of NBA players from 1999-2020, which we found odd considering Asia has the largest populations. We d id a deeper dive to see what teams across the league are signing the most international players, and what we discovered is that, while international players are represented on all 30 teams, the Toronto Raptors have signed the most international players with 44 from 1999-2020. On the other hand, the Miami Heat have employed the least amount of international players with only 14 in that same timespan.

Lastly, we took a look at what regions are producing the highest paid players to see if there is any correlation with region and player salary, as well as to see if that has changed over time. In our findings, we noticed that players from the Mountain West region also had the lowest average salary amongst players compared to other regions. We dove deeper to see how salaries have changed over time for each region and while salaries across the league have grown tremendously in recent years, the Northeast region has not grown at the same level as other regions.
